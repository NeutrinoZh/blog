*Platform: VR (SteamVR, Meta Link PC, Meta Quest)*


*Stack: Unity, OpenXR, Wwise, URP, Netcode for GameObjects*

I collaborated with the designer to bring our game to life, tackling all the
technical challenges. I crafted intricate game mechanics, fine-tuned it for
Android (Quest 2), and conjured stunning shaders and particles (visual
graph, VFX). I also wove in seamless multiplayer functionality (netcodes for
gameobjects and relay). I also ported the game to Steam, working with the
Steam API. My toolkit also included the OpenXR and Wwise SDK, ensuring
an immersive and polished experience
