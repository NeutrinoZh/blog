## [The Cooking Game VR](https://www.meta.com/ru-ru/experiences/pcvr/1304948539547215/)

*Platform: VR (SteamVR, Meta Link PC, Meta Quest)*

*Stack: Unity, OpenXR, Wwise, URP, Netcode for GameObjects*

I collaborated with the designer to bring our game to life, tackling all the
technical challenges. I crafted intricate game mechanics, fine-tuned it for
Android (Quest 2), and conjured stunning shaders and particles (visual
graph, VFX). I also wove in seamless multiplayer functionality (netcodes for
gameobjects and relay). I also ported the game to Steam, working with the
Steam API. My toolkit also included the OpenXR and Wwise SDK, ensuring
an immersive and polished experience

*Platform: Android*

*Stack: Unity, DOTween, UI Toolkit, Github Actions with GameCI*

The project architecture is based on the Model-View-Presenter pattern along with the Services pattern for better separation of concerns. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are set up using GitHub Actions and Game CI, automating the build and testing processes for efficient development workflows.

*Platform: Android*

*Stack: Java, LibGDX, Google AdMob, Python*

The game was developed in a couple of days during my first-year vacation in collage. Interestingly, for the leaderboards, I decided to write my own service in Python, which I then hosted on Heroku. There are several locations that unlock as you progress, but otherwise, itâ€™s just the usual dino game.

## Tank World

*Platform: PC*

*Stack: C++, SDL2*

One of my first more or less finished games, which I wrote in 8th grade. At that time, I wrote my first game engine for it, which I later used to develop a few smaller games. In this game, rendering was done through SDLRenderer, but over time, I transitioned the engine to OpenGL.
