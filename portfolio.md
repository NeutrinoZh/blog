## [The Cooking Game VR](https://www.meta.com/ru-ru/experiences/pcvr/1304948539547215/)

*Platform: VR (SteamVR, Meta Link PC, Meta Quest)*

*Stack: Unity, OpenXR, Wwise, URP, Netcode for GameObjects*

I collaborated with the designer to bring our game to life, tackling all the
technical challenges. I crafted intricate game mechanics, fine-tuned it for
Android (Quest 2), and conjured stunning shaders and particles (visual
graph, VFX). I also wove in seamless multiplayer functionality (netcodes for
gameobjects and relay). I also ported the game to Steam, working with the
Steam API. My toolkit also included the OpenXR and Wwise SDK, ensuring
an immersive and polished experience

![Asset Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeutrinoZh/blog/master/media/portfolio/asset-pipeline.png)  

## [Asset Pipeline](https://github.com/WindEntertainment/wind/blob/master/docs/wind/AssetPipeline.md)

*Platform: PC, Android*

*Stack: C++, Zlib*

In game development, raw resources, such as graphics, audio, and other multimedia elements, are often not initially optimized for efficient usage within games. These resources may come in high-resolution formats or sizes that can impact the game's performance, increase loading times, and consume unnecessary storage space.

The Asset Pipeline module addresses this challenge by serving as a vital intermediary step in the development process. It takes raw, unoptimized resources and transforms them into a format suitable for seamless integration and optimal performance within the game.
